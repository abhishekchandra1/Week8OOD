1. All the things were simple to run. Mostly things were easy.
2. The only problem we faced was in Player and TheDungeon Class.

Player.java:
As we were using different other classes like Pouch, Sword and Armour. So accessing those class elements
was one of the challenge we faced. So to avoid this i made different functions for each functionality i
needed in that way it was easy for me to check individual class functions by testing each function individualy, 
this helped me in solving that problem in Player Class.

TheDungeon.java:
After all the classes and functions and also after testing each class individually, the main problem was to
develop a working main in which all the classes will be combined and run simultanelouly for the game. This was one
of the problems in the project. Simply i organized the code in main with single function first like for attack then
for using potion and so on and so this was also solved and i was able to make a main before the deadline.
